1.2.0
-----
* Use newer libkern/OSByteOrder.h on Mac OS X if available.
* Enable running as non-root on systems that support using SOCK_DGRAM
__for sending ICMP packets.  (set environment variable $JICMP_USE_SOCK_DGRAM
__to enable)  Note: you can get different errno values if you use this option,
__be prepared to handle it properly in your code.

1.0.12
------
* Fix to work with picky compilers
* Fixes for some Windows compilation issues
* Clean up build system since moving to git

1.0.11

* A few minor build-system tweaks

1.0.9
-----
* major Win32 fixes, including a bug that would cause exceptions if you
__start attempting to receive packets before the first is sent
* support for building on Win64 (use the java.io.FileDescriptor's 'handle'
__rather than 'fd', since SOCKETs on Windows are a native HANDLE type)
* minor build-system cleanup; CMake still only works with visual studio on
__Win32 right now; for MinGW use MSYS and autoconf

1.0.8
-----
* build system cleanups
* minor Win32 fixes

1.0.7
-----

-----

* changed sprintf calls to snprintf to fix potential errno overflow issues
* fixed build with Sun CC (if you need to build 64-bit binaries, you will
__need to set -xarch manually in your CFLAGS)
* fixed detection of some system headers
* builds with gcj
